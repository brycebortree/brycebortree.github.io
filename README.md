<h2>Build Technique</h2>
  <p>
    I see my portfolio as a chance to focus on Front End Design and explore how I present myself on the web. I started with the basic content I knew I wanted to include: information about me, skillsets, projects I'm working on, past experience, and a picture so I don't come across as a serial killer. I've been iterating over my portfolio as time has gone on and will continue to do so, styling with basic HTML, CSS, and some Javascript effets and then incorporating more images and more skrollr effets as time has gone on. My next goal is to incorporate AngularJS into my project displays.
